# Hints

Glide supports a `hint` mode that lets you operate web pages entirely using the keyboard.

Press `f` to enter `hint` mode and Glide will overlay text [labels](#label-generation) over every [hintable](#hintable-elements) element, e.g. links and buttons. Typing the [label](#label-generation) for a hint will then focus and click the element.

You can press `<Esc>` to exit `hint` mode at any time.

**Note:** Hints are static. Scroll or DOM changes require pressing `f` again to regenerate, although existing hints will still point to their original elements.

# Reference

## Hintable elements

An element is considered "hintable" if any of the following are true:

- It is one of `html:<a>`, `html:<input>`, `html:<textarea>`, `html:<button>`, `html:<details>`, `html:<option>`, `html:<label>`, `html:<toolbarbutton>`, `html:<richlistitem>`, `html:<menulist>`, `html:<checkbox>`, or `html:<radio>`.
- It has one of the following [roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles): `link`, `button`, `option`, `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `tab`, `checkbox`, `radio`.
- The element is editable

Then, for the element to actually have a hint generated, it must be visible on the page and not be overlapped by another element.

For example, if a modal is open then only elements *inside* the modal will have hints.

## Label generation

Labels are generated using the following lowercase alphabet with this priority order:

```

```

Currently, this alphabet cannot be changed.

If there are too many hints for each label to have a single character from the alphabet, then labels are generated by appending additional characters from the same alphabet. For example, if there are 30 hintable elements on a page:
- Elements 2-26 get single-character labels: `j`, `k`, `l`, `a` etc.
- Elements 1 & 27-30 get two-character labels: `hh`, `hj`, `hk`, `hl`

## Default key mappings

| Key         | Action                                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `f`         | Enter `hint` mode and activate the selected element via click.   |
| `F`         | Enter `hint` mode and activate the selected element in a new tab |
| `<leader>f` | Enter `hint` mode for elements in the browser UI                 |
| `<esc>`     | Leave `hint` mode and clear all labels                           |

<!-- TODO: link `<leader>` to other docs explaining the leader key once they exist. -->
