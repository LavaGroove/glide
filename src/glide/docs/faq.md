## Why Firefox?

At the time of writing, there are no viable alternatives that are not _just_ Chromium.

Building on Chromium would be an uphill battle fighting against changes that Google makes to purely benefit itself, like the manifest v2 removal.

No matter what you think of Mozilla's leadership, Firefox has stayed the most true to FOSS and Mozilla are held to much higher standards than their competitors.

side note: Ladybird is very promising and I hope their project is a success!

## Why not X extension?
