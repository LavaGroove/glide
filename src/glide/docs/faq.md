{% /slot %}

At the time of writing, there are no viable alternatives that are not _just_ Chromium.

Building on Chromium would be an uphill battle fighting against changes that Google makes to purely benefit itself, like the manifest v2 removal.

No matter what you think of Mozilla's leadership, Firefox has stayed the most true to FOSS and Mozilla are held to much higher standards than their competitors.

side note: Ladybird is very promising and I hope their project is a success!

{% details heading=true %} {% slot "summary" %}Why can't I play DRM content?
{% /slot %}

DRM is a walled garden and [blocked for open source browsers](https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/google-widevine-blocked-my-browser/), at the least the kind not ran by a large organisation.

Additionally, a widevine license would be prohibitively expensive, even if we would be accepted.

This is also a matter of principle, you should reconsider if it's worth using services that require DRM and proprietary software. See [deffective by design](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/).
